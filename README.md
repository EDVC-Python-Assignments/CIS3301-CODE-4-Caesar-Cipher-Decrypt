## CODE-4-Caesar-Cipher-Decryption

## Instructions

In this CODE assignment, you will program part of a Caesar Cipher. The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest mechanisms to encrypt information. The cipher relies on substitution to encrypt and decrypt information. In this assignment, we will only decrypt information. Therefore, I recommend using your CODE 3 assignment for testing the functionality of your code

There are two elements in a Caesar Cipher:

*  Encrypted: word(s) to decrypt
*  Key: number of characters the word will be changed by.


## Use the following user prompts

* Welcome the user
  + **"\nCaesar Cipher - Program"**
* Request the encrypted message from the user
  + **"\nEnter the secret to decrypt: "** (note the space after the colon)
* Request the key from the user
  + **"Enter your key: "** (note the space after the colon)
* Return the secret to the user
  + **"\nThe secret is original_message\n"** (replace original_message with the appropriate variable)

## Some encrypted messages you can use for testing

+  "rtcevkegaocmguaocuvgt{" key: 2
+  "Hp!Njofst" key: 1
+  "HobSdvrbVwurqj" key: 3
